    "\n",
    "- Create your own dataset for custom human motions using Phyphox\n",
    "- There should be at least 3 distinct types of motions\n",

    "For this assignment you will create your own dataset of motions that you collect with an Accelerometer and Gyroscope. For this you can use your phone as a sensor.\n",
    "To be able to collect your data you can best use an app called [phyphox](https://phyphox.org/), this is a free app available in app stores. This app can be configured to acces your sensordata, sample it as given frequency's. you can set it up te have experiment timeslots, and the data with a timestamp can be exported to a needed output format.\n",

    "When you installed the app you can setup a custum experiment by clicking on the + button. Define an experiment name, sample frequency and activate the Accelerometer and Gyroscope. Your custom experiment will be added, you can run it pressing the play button and you will see sensor motion. Pressing the tree dots (...) lets you define timed runs, remote access and exporting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phyphox will generate 2 files with sensor data, one for the Accelerometer and one for the Giro. Both files will have timestamps which might not match the recorded sensor data for each sensor. Please, preprocess and merge the files for using it as your dataset for training, testing and deploying your own supervised learning model.\n",

    "### Problem Description\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to develop a machine learning model capable of recognizing specific human activities based on sensor data. We will distinguish between three gestures using data collected from a smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selected Activities\n",
    "We have chosen three motions that involve different arm trajectories and intensities:\n",
    "1.  **Drawing the letter 'O':** A continuous circular motion performed in the air.\n",
    "2.  **Throwing a ball:** A rapid, linear acceleration followed by a deceleration.\n",
    "3.  **Opening a door:** A reach-and-pull or push-and-turn motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach & Methodology\n",
    "*   **Data Collection:** We will use the **Phyphox** app to record 3-axis Accelerometer and Gyroscope data.\n",
    "*   **Hardware Consistency:** To eliminate overfitting to one specific device its sensors, we will use 2 different smartphones for all data collection. If this turns out to still be an issue, we will add 1 device more.\n",
    "*   **Bias Mitigation:** To ensure our model learns the motion rather than a specific person's movement style, we will have each group member perform 10 movements with one phone, following 10 times the same movement with the other phone. this results in total 60 samples per activity which consist of 2 different phones and 3 different people, totalling 180 samples.\n"

    "# 2. Get the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Collection Protocol\n",
    "To ensure good data and minimize bias, we have established the following protocol:\n",
    "*   **Device:** Two phones will be used for all recordings to eliminate hardware sensor variance.\n",
    "*   **Participants:** each group member will perform the motions to prevent the model from overfitting to a single person's movement style.\n",
    "*   **Volume:** We aim for 20 samples per person per movement with 10 samples on each phone.\n",
    "*   **Sampling:** We will use fixed time windows in Phyphox to ensure consistent data length for each sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Classes\n",
    "We will classify the following 3 activities:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Opening a Door\n",
    "*   **Action:** Miming the action of reaching for a handle, turning/pushing, and returning.\n",
    "*   **Start Position:** Hands beside the body.\n",
    "*   **Movement:** As shown in the video [TODO: Add video reference].\n",
    "*   **End Position:** Hands beside the body.\n",
    "*   **Phone Orientation:** [TODO: Add image of phone grip]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Drawing the Letter 'O'\n",
    "*   **Action:** Drawing a large circle in the air.\n",
    "*   **Start Position:** Hands in front of the body at the top of the 'O'.\n",
    "*   **Movement:** As shown in the video [TODO: Add video reference].\n",
    "*   **End Position:** Same as start position (completing the loop).\n",
    "*   **Phone Orientation:** [TODO: Add image of phone grip]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Throwing a Ball\n",
    "*   **Action:** Miming an overhand throw.\n",
    "*   **Start Position:** Hands beside the body.\n",
    "*   **Movement:** As shown in the video [TODO: Add video reference].\n",
    "*   **End Position:** Hand at the top of the arc, after the \"release\".\n",
    "*   **Phone Orientation:** [TODO: Add image of phone grip]"

    "**1. The `Activity` Label:**\n",
    "Instead of creating separate variables for each folder, we add an `Activity` column.\n",

    "**2. The `Sample_ID`:**\n",
    "*   We assign a unique `Sample_ID` to every 5-second recording found.\n",
    "*   This allows us to distinguish between individual movements (e.g., \"Door Movement #1\", \"Door Movement #2\") within the large dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this format?**\n",
    "This \"Long Format\" (Time-Series) is the standard starting point. In **Step 4**, we will group by `Sample_ID` to calculate features (e.g., mean acceleration, max gyro) for each unique movement, creating the final training set. -->"
